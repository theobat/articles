What is it that you call "mathematics" ?

## Introduction

I've been asking this question to myself for a while. I remember when I first realized that mathematics
where not exactly the expression of my intuition, you know the very common idea that 1+1=2 is so obvious because you can
"prove it" with your fingers or that the idea of infinity is just the reproduction of something forever. 
It happened when I was 17 years old, and I thought the result of this question was 1:

My reasoning was simple: 1 + 1/n goes to 1 when n goes to infinity thus multiplying it by itself an infinite number of times,
would yield to something close to 1.
The "correct" answer is the real number [e](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_(mathematical_constant)) and the proof is rather straightforward when you hear it from a math teacher.
I didn't have a very good understanding of the exponential function at the time and I later found the manipulation of infinities to be even
trickier than I thought.

Then there was my first introduction to a programming language, Ada in 2012.
At this time I didn't uderstand matrices, groups, rings, hilbert spaces, etc you name it; But I got used to them.
I was not, however, prepared to see something like ```x := x + 1```
where the substitution principle of the equal sign (the so-called "referential transparency")
is not respected. It is fortunate that the Ada syntax uses a ":=" instead of the rather usual "="
sign that I encoutered just a bit after Ada (in C).

I sorely missed mathematics when I started programming, and to some extent I still do. But I'm really happy to have encoutered
what's called language theory along with programming because it enabled a paradigm shift in my mind about sciences in general
and mathematics in particular.
Mathematics were just like any programming language, id est, a language. And programming languages were
just like any other languages, a set of symbols (an alphabet), a set of words (variables), and a set of verbs (reserved words)
and a set of grammatical rules to compose these words. At least that was the idea.

This article is here to witness the evolution of my view on mathematics for the past 4-5 years,
along with my readings, my discoveries in math, logic, philosophy, epistemology and history of sciences.
I will begin by a short exploration of the history of mathematics, I will then present the current directions taken for 
"new foundations", if any, and I will then end by a rather opinonated critique of the current relationship our society has with the field.
